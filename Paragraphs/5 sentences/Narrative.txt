The boy drags a broken kite through the field as if hoping the wind will fix it. His sister once buried three coins under the oak near the creek, swearing they'd grow into something valuable. Now, the wind howls hard enough to make the grass flatten sideways, but no kite lifts. Tomorrow, a dog with a red collar will dig near that same oak and uncover only rusted metal. Their father, meanwhile, still believes the coins were never buried at all.

Behind the third door of the hallway, a glass tank holds two chameleons locked in a silent standoff. A scientist with a crooked spine studies their stillness, convinced it's a kind of language beyond movement. The room smells faintly of citrus, although no fruit has ever crossed its threshold. Later, she will write down that the smaller chameleon blinked first, though she doubts her own eyes. Somewhere above them, a vent squeals once and then goes quiet forever.

Maria places five stones in a perfect arc on the windowsill and labels each with a letter she refuses to explain. Across the street, a man in a striped coat folds paper cranes and lets them fall from his balcony without watching. The fourth one lands on a delivery van and sticks there until the next rainfall. Two of Maria’s stones vanish overnight, leaving faint circular smudges behind. Her neighbor starts painting every brick on his side of the wall a different shade of green.

A black cat watches as three sparrows steal crumbs from a torn loaf near the alley gate. Its tail flicks only once, but the motion scatters the birds into uneven arcs. Beneath the cat, an ant trail breaks its usual path and forms the shape of a crooked four. By noon tomorrow, the loaf will be gone, but the trail will double back, now avoiding the exact shape it once drew. The cat never leaves the shadow of the fence post, not even when the gate opens wide.

Two twins in matching grey sweatshirts take turns throwing pebbles into a fountain with no water. Each pebble makes a different sound depending on the angle of the throw, but neither speaks. The seventh pebble lodges itself in a crack, and the older twin leaves it there without comment. A woman walks past carrying a cactus wrapped in purple cloth, unaware that the fountain once held koi. One twin thinks about stealing the cactus, but doesn’t move.
