A black hole forms when a massive star collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life cycle. The resulting singularity has a gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape. Surrounding this point is the event horizonâ€”the boundary beyond which information cannot return.

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy. Chlorophyll absorbs light, which drives a reaction that splits water and fixes carbon dioxide into glucose. Oxygen is released as a byproduct of this conversion.

A copyright grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to use and distribute it. These rights typically cover reproduction, performance, and adaptation of the material. While the protection is automatic, registration can help enforce claims legally.

Earthquakes occur when stress along geological faults exceeds the strength of surrounding rock. This sudden release of energy propagates as seismic waves, shaking the Earth's surface. Magnitude measures the energy released, while intensity describes the observed effects.

The placebo effect occurs when a person experiences a real change in symptoms after receiving an inactive treatment. This response is driven by expectations, belief, and psychological factors rather than the treatment itself. It illustrates how perception can influence physiological outcomes.
