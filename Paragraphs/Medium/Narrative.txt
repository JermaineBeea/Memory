A silver falcon once circled above a village where no one dared to plant roses. Beneath its flight path, three children gathered pebbles shaped like teardrops and arranged them in spirals across the cracked earth. The villagers, still unsure whether the falcon was a blessing or a warning, avoided looking directly at it. One morning, without any announcement, the spirals began to glow softly, and from their centers sprouted vines bearing leaves that hummed faintly. Now, every traveler who passes through the village leaves behind a stone of their own, adding to the spirals without asking why.

On a narrow ridge above a still lake, six wooden masks were nailed to a tree with no roots in sight. The wind pushes them into a slow, rhythmic dance, though no breeze is ever felt nearby. A fox with one ear missing often circles the base of the tree, dragging its tail in the dust and drawing symbols no one understands. The villagers believe the masks watch the paths and shift their expressions when strangers arrive. Someday, someone may try to remove one, and when that happens, the ridge will either vanish entirely or speak in a voice made of rain.

Deep within a sunken orchard where apples do not fall, two deer with golden eyes walk backward through tangled vines. Their hooves never break the fallen branches, and wherever they step, the soil remains untouched. Above them, branches twist into shapes resembling open mouths and shut doors. Once, a hunter dropped his bow at the orchardâ€™s edge and refused to cross its threshold, though no one had told him to stop. In the seasons that followed, moss grew over the bow until only the string remained, humming softly whenever the deer passed nearby.

Three towers, each built from a different kind of stone, stand crooked at the border between two forgotten countries. The northern tower is covered in feathers that never fall, the middle one holds seven locked doors with no hinges, and the southern leans so far it casts no shadow. A child once traced a path between the towers with breadcrumbs made of clay, and though the wind scattered them, a line remains where nothing grows. Occasionally, the stones in the northern tower rearrange themselves overnight, forming new shapes no one recalls building in the first place.

Beyond a plain of rust-colored grass, a boat rests upright on a hill with no water in sight. Four crows have nested in its cabin, and they switch places silently every time the wind changes. Beneath the boat lies a circle of coins from places that do not exist on any map. A herd of horses, painted with handprints in black and blue, migrates past the hill in a precise loop, leaving the same prints on nearby rocks. One day, the boat will drift again, not through water but across the plains, carving a trail no foot has ever touched.
