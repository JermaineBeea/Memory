The behaviour of slime moulds challenges the distinction between intelligence and instinct in non-neural organisms. Despite lacking a brain or nervous system, these single-celled entities can solve mazes, optimize networks, and adapt to changing environments through decentralized decision-making. Their actions suggest that cognition may emerge from spatial and chemical processes, not just biological complexity.

Neural plasticity declines with age, but targeted techniques like interleaved learning and retrieval practice enhance synaptic efficiency in the prefrontal cortex. Memory consolidation demands both stability and adaptability, balancing hippocampal encoding with cortical integration. Metacognitive judgments often mislead, causing overconfidence and weakening the impact of effortful recall.

In high-altitude ballooning, pressure disparity strains the balloon envelope over time. Engineers use adaptive algorithms to adjust inflation based on barometric data. Solar radiation, if uncorrected, disrupts buoyancy and destabilizes flight.

Quantum decoherence occurs when environmental entanglement erases phase coherence, turning quantum states into classical ones. It bridges quantum indeterminacy and classical determinism by diffusing information into hidden variables. Decoherence happens fast in complex systems, making macroscopic quantum effects nearly impossible to observe.

Cryptophyte algae contain a tiny, hidden structure called a nucleomorph. It is the remnant of a red alga that was absorbed long ago. This shows how some organisms evolve by merging with others, layer by layer.
